# api-gateway

An API gateway is a component that sits between your backend services and your API clients. It acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests from clients to the appropriate backend service 
and then returning the serviceâ€™s response back to the client. An API gateway can also perform tasks such as authentication, rate limiting, and caching.

Spring Cloud Gateway is a lightweight, reactive API gateway built on top of the Spring framework. It is designed to provide a simple, yet powerful way to route and manage network traffic to your applications.

Spring Cloud Gateway uses a reactive, non-blocking architecture that can scale to handle a large number of concurrent requests.
It can be used to route traffic to different backend services based on the incoming request, perform authentication and authorization, and perform other tasks such as rate limiting and caching
